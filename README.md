# Emergent Entity Framework

## Overview

The **Emergent Entity Framework** is a novel approach to designing adaptive, collaborative, and task-oriented systems where behavior emerges from the interactions of dynamic entities. Unlike traditional agent-based systems, this framework focuses on **emergent behavior** as a core feature, enabling entities to learn, adapt, and collaborate in real-time.

This framework is designed for applications in **collaborative learning**, **adaptive decision-making**, and **decentralized problem-solving**. It is particularly well-suited for domains where flexibility, scalability, and emergent intelligence are critical.

## Key Features

### 1. **Emergent Behavior**
   - Entities derive their behavior dynamically from interactions and shared knowledge, rather than following pre-programmed rules.
   - Behavior emerges from the collective interactions of entities, enabling complex problem-solving and adaptability.

### 2. **Collaborative Learning**
   - Entities share knowledge and learn from one another, enabling collaborative problem-solving and continuous improvement.
   - Knowledge is stored in a shared **Holographic Memory**, allowing entities to encode and retrieve information dynamically.

### 3. **Task-Oriented Design**
   - The framework is designed to handle specific tasks across multiple domains (e.g., math, English, Python, science).
   - Tasks are distributed to entities, which process them and share results, enabling cross-domain learning.

### 4. **Dynamic Entity Management**
   - Entities can be dynamically merged or split, allowing the system to adapt to changing requirements.
   - Merging entities combines their knowledge, while splitting creates new entities with shared knowledge.

### 5. **Synchronization and Optimization**
   - The **Entanglement Hub** synchronizes entities, enabling knowledge sharing and collaboration.
   - The **Learning Engine** optimizes learning pathways based on task results, ensuring continuous improvement.

## How It Works

### 1. **Entity Core**
   - Each entity is an instance of the `EmergentEntityCore` class, which interacts with a domain-specific module (e.g., `EmergentMathEntity`, `EmergentEnglishEntity`).
   - Entities process tasks, encode results in **Holographic Memory**, and share knowledge with other entities.

### 2. **Meta Entity**
   - The `EmergentMetaEntity` class manages a collection of entities and distributes tasks across domains.
   - It handles entity merging, splitting, and synchronization through the **Entanglement Hub**.

### 3. **Task Distribution**
   - Tasks are defined as dictionaries and distributed to entities based on their domain.
   - Example tasks include:
     - **Math**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.
     - **English**: Vocabulary, grammar rules.
     - **Python**: Code evaluation, debugging, function definition.
     - **Science**: Biology, chemistry, physics, astronomy.

### 4. **Knowledge Sharing**
   - Entities share knowledge through the **Holographic Memory**, which stores input-output pairs for tasks.
   - The **Entanglement Hub** synchronizes entities, ensuring that shared knowledge is propagated across the system.

### 5. **Learning and Optimization**
   - The **Learning Engine** analyzes task results and optimizes learning pathways for entities.
   - If a task fails, the learning rate is adjusted, and the system evolves to improve performance.

## Example Use Cases

### 1. **Collaborative Learning**
   - Entities in different domains (e.g., math, English) share knowledge, enabling cross-domain learning and problem-solving.

### 2. **Adaptive Decision-Making**
   - The system adapts to new tasks and environments by dynamically merging or splitting entities and optimizing learning pathways.

### 3. **Decentralized Problem-Solving**
   - Entities work together to solve complex problems without centralized control, demonstrating emergent intelligence.

## Getting Started

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rainmanp7/emergent-entity-framework.git
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Framework
1. Run the `teaching v2.py` script to initialize the system and teach the entities:
   ```bash
   python teaching v2.py
   ```
2. Run the `crosstrain v2.py` script to perform cross-training and enable emergent behavior:
   ```bash
   python crosstrain v2.py
   ```

### Example Tasks
- **Math**:
  ```python
  {"type": "addition", "a": 15, "b": 20}
  ```
- **English**:
  ```python
  {"type": "vocabulary", "word": "resilient", "definition": "able to recover quickly from difficulties"}
  ```
- **Python**:
  ```python
  {"type": "evaluate", "code": "print(5 * 5)"}
  ```
- **Science**:
  ```python
  {"type": "biology", "question": "What is DNA?", "answer": "Deoxyribonucleic acid, the molecule that carries genetic information."}
  ```
